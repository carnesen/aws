# @carnesen/aws 

A library for deploying my projects to AWS. Since this code doesn't have a "build" step, I'm currently consuming it as a ["Git URL" npm dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependencies) as in [this package.json file](https://github.com/carnesen/mathjs/blob/60db2adec84ea8c9ce6dc5df804750e7bbcbd6a6/package.json#L36)

For example usage see https://github.com/carnesen/mathjs/tree/master/scripts and https://github.com/carnesen/www/tree/master/scripts
